# dj_chrono
An example node.js based SlackBot for connecting to the Toggl API (and more!)


To try this bot out yourself, clone this repo, [create a bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot), add the token to `dj_chrono.js`, add your e-mail to the `user_agent` param on the Toggl API, `npm install` then `node dj_chrono.js`. Enjoy!
